        <h2>Our cookies...</h2>
        <p>Are not your normal, everyday cookies. Our cookies are custom decorated. They're made with brown sugar and cream cheese, so they're chewy, soft, and delicious.
        The frosting is also soft, flavored with a touch of orange.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're bound to love these cookies.</p>

        <h2>OK, but what's a "fluffy butt?"</h2>
        <p>Fluffybutt doesn't refer to fluffy butts, literally. Instead, it's the affectionate nickname that I give to the type of cats that I tend to own.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The cat photo'd here is a textbook fluffybutt.</p>
